This project develops a pricing-grade loss cost model for a Commercial Auto insurance portfolio using R. It replicates the same frequency–severity modeling framework used by insurers such as Progressive, GEICO, Travelers, and Nationwide.

The analysis includes:

- Data preparation & cleaning
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Frequency modeling using a Poisson GLM
- Severity modeling using a Gamma GLM
- Pure premium prediction (expected loss cost)
- Segmentation analysis by industry, territory, and vehicle type
- Visual insights and model outputs exported for review
